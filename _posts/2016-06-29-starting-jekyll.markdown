# Learining Jekyll

I recently put this site up - wanted a quick, controlled way of putting content & thoughts down and after attending API days looked to give Jekyll a try.

## Goals

Driven from a repository - version controlled
Hostable
Continuous delivery

## Best fit (so far)

* Jekyll
* Heroku
* github repo


# What's useful
