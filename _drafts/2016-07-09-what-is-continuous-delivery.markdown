# What is Continuous Delivery?

>The ability to get changes, whether they be features, configuration, bug fixes or experiments into the hands of your users & customers in a fast, safe & sustainable way.

# Why??

The history of Death march projects and planning for releases, late evenings with multiple people & teams, massive run sheets... is there a better way?

To a 'boring low risk event' - midday.

>Changes to market faster with less cost, effort & to get faster feedback.

Also, increase software quality and stability.

Increases customer & employee satisfaction. 

Rapid smaller changes. (Amazon a change/release - every 11.6 seconds - 50M deploys annually)

# Agile Adoption

'WaterScrumfall..' Agile embedded in a Project management, Portfolio framework. The 'fuzzy front end'.

Weeks, Months..?

Are those iterations going to production...?

Goal: Make the 'last mile' go away.. can we ship to users at end of iteration or faster. 'Shifting left'

# What changes at development time?
 
* Build quality in
* Releaseable to production,
