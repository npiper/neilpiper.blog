# Concept

Illustrate to the technical community the underpinning philosophical basis of Agile & the lean enterprise.

Locke, Hume

What are the competing philosophies, inherent in Taylorism etc; that struggle with Agile's philosophy of Empiricism?

Taylorism weaknesses in service, knowledge work:

* Problem of Separation of Planning from Doing
* 'Functional foremanship' - Unity of command broken - workers have to report to eight bosses
* Mechanical - no human factors, cogs in the machine
* Favours individual measurement, performance over teamwork, group performance
* Not all workers only motivated by money
* can be applied only when the performance of the workers can be measured quantitatively

"the extent to which we are dependent upon sense experience in our effort to gain knowledge"

Innate Knowledge - I know this without needing to sense, experience it
Innate Concept - Mental concepts, contexts have not been gained from experience (i.e Spirituality, God, creative ideas or visions invented by us)

`Best Practice` as a red flag to Agilists as it is to a degree favouring the 'Innate knowledge' concept.
